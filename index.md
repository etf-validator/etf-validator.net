### ETF test framework

It has originally been developed during the ESDIN project based on a patched version of soapUI and improved with additional capabilities (through Groovy scripts). In the ESDIN project also projects for testing view, download and transformation services as well as ExM data had been developed.

Outside the ELF project a test driver has been developed for the BaseX database which supports the testing of large scale XML data, including Schematron tests, geometry validation and geometric predicates -with support for spacial indexing.

### Ongoing development
Currently a new ETF version 2 is developed which is used as the basis for the INSPIRE test framework.
